    <p>When the boy is in the third grade or 9 (or as soon as he completes the Bobcat requirements if he joins at this age), he begins work toward the Bear rank. When he has completed 12 of the 24 achievements and has been awarded the badge, he may work
      on the 24 electives in the Bear Cub Scout Book to earn arrow points as he did for Wolf. These arrow points are worn below his Bear badge. In addition, he may earn elective credits by completing requirements for the 12 achievements not used to earn
      the Bear badge. All requirements for both the Bear achievements and electives are found in the Bear Cub Scout Book. As with the Wolf rank, completion of the requirements is approved by the boyâ€™s parents.</p>

    <p>To earn the Bear Badge, a Cub Scout must complete 12 achievements out of a possible 24 that are offered in the book. The achievements are grouped in 4 major areas, GOD, COUNTRY, FAMILY, and SELF. Within each group, a required number of achievements
      must be completed, as indicated below. Also, any achievements that they do NOT use to earn the Bear Badge may be used to earn Arrow Points. <a href="http://www.ocbsa.org/bear-rank-and-requirements/">(source)</a>
