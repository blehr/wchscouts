    <p>To begin his path to the Tiger Cub rank, the Tiger Cub (age 7) must learn the Cub Scout promise, the Cub Scout sign, and the Cub Scout salute. When he has learned these, he gets his Tiger Cub emblem, which is a tiger paw with four strings for beads.
      He wears the emblem on his right pocket.</p>

    <p>As a boy finishes each part of the five Tiger Cub achievements, he earns an orange bead (for den activities), a white bead (for family activities), or a black bead (for “Go See Its”). When the boy has earned five beads of each color, he can receive
      his Tiger Cub badge. The Tiger Cub badge is given to the boy’s adult partner at a pack meeting. Then, during a grand ceremony, the adult gives the badge to the boy. <a href="http://www.ocbsa.org/tiger-cub-and-requirements/">(source)</a>
