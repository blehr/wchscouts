    <p>No matter what age or grade a boy joins Cub Scouting, he must earn his Bobcat Badge before he can advance to the rank of Tiger Cub, Wolf, Bear, or Webelos. A boy must complete the Bobcat requirements, which include demonstrating his understanding
      of Scouting's core values. He must be able to recite the Scout Law, Scout Oath, and motto and demonstrate the Cub Scout sign, handshake, and salute. He must also explain what each of these ideals means, in addition to demonstrating his understanding
      of the core values of honesty and trustworthiness, and explaining their importance. <a href="http://meritbadge.org/wiki/index.php/Bobcat_badge">(source)</a>
