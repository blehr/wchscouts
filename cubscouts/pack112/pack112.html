            <span>Cub Scout Pack 112</span>is Washington Courthouse's gateway into the world of scouting. We have been blessed to have been chartered by the First Presbyterian Church of Washington CH. This is our home base of operation, where we hold
            our pack and den meetings. Unless of course we are out on one of our many Go-See-It adventures. If you would like to learn more about us and what we offer, please feel free to contact us, <a href="mailto:wchpack112@gmail.com">wchpack112@gmail.com</a>

            <span>Cub Scouting Program</span>- Youth members ages 6-10 join a Cub Scout pack and are assigned to a den, usually a neighborhood group of six to eight boys. Tiger Cubs (first-graders), Wolf Cub Scouts (second-graders), Bear Cub Scouts (third-graders),
            and Webelos Scouts (fourth- and fifth-graders) meet weekly. Once a month all of the dens and family members gather for a pack meeting under the direction of a Cubmaster and pack committee. The committee includes parents of boys in the pack
            and members of the chartered organization. <a href="http://www.skcscouts.org/about-us/">(source)</a>
