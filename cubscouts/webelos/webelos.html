  <div class="intro">
    <p>WEBELOS Dens are for boys who have completed third grade (or reached age 10). The WEBELOS Den program is different from the Cub Scout Den program. Everything in the WEBELOS Scout program is more challenging than what younger boys in the Pack do.</p>

    <p>When he has earned the Arrow of Light Award (or is 11 years old or has completed the fifth grade), the boy makes a transition from the Pack to a Boy Scout Troop in an impressive ‘crossover’ pack ceremony.</p>

    <p>The WEBELOS badge and Arrow of Light requirements include all of the joining requirements for the ‘Scout’ badge. <a href="http://www.ocbsa.org/webelos-rank-and-requirements/">(source)</a>
